"""test cst.units module

Only works in CST 2026.

It seems that the `cst.units` module provides a way to create physical 
quantities with units, but in CST 2024 and 2025, the module is not fully 
functional or documented. Therefore, this test script demonstrates how to use 
the `cst.units` module in CST 2026, where it appears to be more complete.
